okay so idea
letme write some psedo code

move3d(x, y, size, time);

this would need an object i really dont like the idea of objects
so lets try this again

move3d(image, x, y, size, x2, y2, size2, time)

this could do it without objects, should this be the way this is done?
there would be 2d versions without the size, and 4d versions with width and height instead of one value
we need objects internally either way i think because we have to separate rendering from logic
